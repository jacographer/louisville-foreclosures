## What still needs to be done
1. Lookup function. Need to be able to type in address, select address, and then trigger the 'click' event which pans and zooms to selected point. We need an autocomplete or suggestion function in order for exact-match searching to work. There's a [Bootstrap autocomplete](https://bootstrap-autocomplete.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) method that we are exploring. Tips very welcome.
2. Text detailing.
3. Clean-up.
